;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains the main keybinding configuration for my Emacs setup,
;; primarily structured around Evil-mode (Vim emulation) and the General
;; package for concise and expressive keybinding definitions.

;;; Code:

;; Required by evil-collection
(use-package evil

  ;; tweak evil's configuration before loading it
  (setq evil-want-integration t) ;; This is optional since it's already set to t by default.
