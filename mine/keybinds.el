;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains the main keybinding configuration for my Emacs setup,
;; primarily structured around Evil-mode (Vim emulation) and the General
;; package for concise and expressive keybinding definitions.

;; Key features:
;; - `evil` is configured with sane defaults, undo-fu integration, and
;;   `evil-surround` for classic Vim-style surround editing.
;; - `evil-collection` ensures Evil integration across standard Emacs packages.
;; - `vim-tab-bar` enhances the tab-bar UI to resemble Vim's tab behavior.
;; - Custom comment operator (`gc`) mirrors Vim's common comment motion.
;; - The `general` package defines a leader key (`SPC`) across all Evil states,
;;   providing a consistent and discoverable keybinding layout via which-key.
;; - Keybindings are grouped by domain (buffers, Dired, eval, help, org,
;;   search, windows) and annotated with `which-key` descriptions for clarity.
;; - Undo history is enhanced with `undo-fu` and session persistence via
;;   `undo-fu-session`.
;; - `which-key` improves discoverability of leader-key shortcuts.
;; - Pixel-precision scrolling is enabled where appropriate, except on
;;   emacs-mac builds.

;; This configuration is modular, lazy-loaded where possible, and tuned for
;; performance and ergonomics.
