;;; Commentary:

;; This file configures `org-mode` for a modern, visually clean, and
;; Evil-friendly Org experience. It enhances both the aesthetics and
;; editing ergonomics of Org documents, while remaining minimal and
;; extensible.

;;; Code:

(use-package org
  :init
  (global-org-modern-mode))

(use-package org-modern
  :config
  ;; Behavior settings
  (setq org-auto-align-tags nil
        org-tags-column 0
        org-agenda-tags-column 0
        org-catch-invisible-edits 'show-and-error
        org-special-ctrl-a/e t
        org-insert-heading-respect-content t

        ;; Visual/style settings
        org-startup-folded 'content
        org-hide-emphasis-markers t
        org-pretty-entities t
        org-ellipsis "â€¦"))

(use-package org-appear
  :hook (org-mode . org-appear-mode))

(use-package evil-org
  :ensure t
  :after org
  :hook (org-mode . (lambda () evil-org-mode))
